# Hello-World Software Development

All new softwares and expectations placed upon developers, creates elitism and exclusion and will just breed more softwares upon softwares and before you know it, you need to know 20 different programs and 2 different frameworks to write "**Hello-World**". Companies of course only hire people who know the latest softwares, while those that are new to the game will fall behind. We ask ourselves, when will this end? If you lack the experience and skills, lack the time and financial stability to upskill, your currently employer does not bother to get you trained up and you are left struggling within a company that has no roots in Information Technology, you will, when you quit or leave wake up to a world you no longer recognize. You are unemployable. You will fail and bail every skill challenge for any job in development you apply for. Time to look for a job at a fast food chain. But wait, there's Hello-World Software Development

In 2022, there are 728 programming languages, frameworks and developer softwares available worldwide. Google it and after a few elaborate researches you will find that that was a lie. Indeed! The reality is that as a developer, you will have to know everything and anything in order to stay employed, be employed in future and to survive. Well, no thank you. This is where the new Hello-World Development comes in! Hello-World Development is a software development methodology that emphasizes to go back to the roots and basics of programming and software development. It relies on the fundamental concept of algorithm design, which should be used to solve any issue and different level of complexity, regardless of programming language used. The solution to a problem is the goal, regardless of how it is achieved. There are countless ways to solve a programming task - why limit everything to **one** way or one standard? Why have 10 developers scrum around agile, to find a solution when in fact it only takes one person and a vision? Why does it matter how you got to a solution, when the end result is exactly the same?

## Hello-World Software Development in a nutshell:

- Code everything in a **simple and easy way**.
- Code anything and everything in as few files as possible.
- Code in the most basic and simple usage of any programming language.
- Goal > Road to Goal.
- You have a vision? Google has the solution!
- Why bother recreating the wheel? Copy-paste is your best friend too! 
- Avoid building from scratch, if you (or someone else) have done something similar before.
- Wipe and try from scratch if nothing works.

## The Hello-World Software Development Cycle:

- repeat : task requested -> just code it -> test it -> present it -> does it work ? release it : change it

## The Hello-World Software Development Solution Approach:

- repeat: try again > google it > check old projects > ask the creator > ask on a developer forum
