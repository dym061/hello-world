# hello-world
hello world repository
my hello-world development approach:
* **Complicate everything** where possible
* Who needs classes, when you can **hard code everything**
* No need for seperate files, code anything and everything in the same file
* Use programming with the most basic usage of php, mysql, html, css, javascript
* No need for fancy frameworks, standards or best practices. goal > road to goal
* Google is your best friend, always. You have a vision? Google has the solution!
* Recycling your old code is of utmost importance
* repeat : task requested -> just code it -> test it -> present it -> does it work ? release it : change it
* someone needs the entire vegetable garden as programming softwares ? nope, basic php, html, css and javascript it is!
* collaboration = google it > check your own old projects >  ask the developer > ask on reddit
* something doesn't work that worked fine before? wipe and try from scratch
